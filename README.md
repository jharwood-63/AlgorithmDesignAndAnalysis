# cs312
This repository contains projects from CS 312 Algorithm Design and Analysis
The UI elements were provided, however all components of the algorithms were written by me.

# Explanations of Projects
  - Project 1 -> Fermat and Miller Rabin algorithms for checking the primality of a number
  - Project 2 -> Divide and conquer approach to the convex hull problem
  - Project 3 -> Dijkstras algorithm to find the shortest path in a network
    - Implemented with a heap queue and an array queue
  - Project 4 -> Dynamic programming approach to Gene Sequencing
  - Project 5 -> Branch and Bound algorithm for solving the Traveling Sales Person Problem
    - Also includes a greedy algorithm approach for solving this problem
